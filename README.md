# Matthew Thomas Portfolio
Hello! My name is Matthew Thomas, and I am an Aerospace Engineering 
Student at the University of Maryland. This portfolio is intended to supplement my 
resume and give you a more profound understanding of my practical experience.
Throughout my college career, I have always sought out the most rewarding projects 
available. As a result, I have participated in variety of projects, inside and outside of 
the classroom, allowing me to improve my engineering knowledge and diversify my 
skillset beyond what I have learned through my internships. I hope that this portfolio
will allow you to better assess my skills and how they can be applied at your 
company. Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio.
